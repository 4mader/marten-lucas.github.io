	// naming of the rods of the foosball table:
	// Px_y_Qualifier
	// x= Player No (1 or 2)
	// y = no of players on rod (1;2;5;3)
	// Qualifiers= 
	//	rod = the layer for the rod only (not the figures)
	//	up = figures are up
	//  back = figures are down and tilted backwards, i.e. towards the own goal
	//  front = figures are down and tilted forwards, i.e. towards the opponent's goal
	//	move_away = the arrow for moving the rod away from the players (due to orientation up/down may change)
	// move_toward = the arrow for moving the rod toward the players
